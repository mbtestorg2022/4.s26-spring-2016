  "course_description": "This course proposes that investigating the ways in which territory is produced, maintained and strategized, generates conflicts, establishes divisions, and builds identities can lead to a more critical understanding of architecture's role in society. This course is designed to expand the student's literacy in the concept of territory and its relation to the realm of architecture.\n",
